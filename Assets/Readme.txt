Player will have an option to start the level in a professor's office.

The professor will ask the player questions, and the player will have to answer them correctly before they're allowed to leave the office.

When the player leaves the ofice, they will return to their room.

The player's objective is to now enter the simulation.

They need to find their stethoscope and white lab coat in order to enter the simulation. These can be found around the level. However, the player's pet iguana is also in the level. If the player steps on the iguana, they will bite the player, causing him/her to drop their items and restart the level.

Once all "artifacts" have been collected, the player can enter the simulation by clicking on the folder.
